Project to learn how to create interpreters and compilers from [Bob Nystrom's](https://github.com/munificent) fantastic book [Crafting Interpreters](https://www.amazon.es/Crafting-Interpreters-Robert-Nystrom/dp/0990582930/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=crafting+interpreters&qid=1644166558&sprefix=crafting+interpre%2Caps%2C99&sr=8-1). 

# GoLox
GoLox is the lox interpreter made with Golang. It's an abstract syntax tree interpreter, so it is easy to understand but slow. You need Go >= 1.17 to build the interpreter, which you can use to run the sample lox file.
